# Home-asset-inventory

This project was completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program.

The purpose of this activity was to identify and document home network assets and classify them based on ownership, network access, physical location, and data sensitivity. Asset inventories are a foundational cybersecurity practice used to understand what systems exist in an environment and what level of protection each asset requires.

| Asset| Network Access | Owner | Location| Notes| Sensitivity|
|--------|-------------| -------|---------|-------|-----------|
|Network router |Continuous|Internet service provider|On-premises|Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices on the home network connect to the 5 GHz frequency.|Confidential|
| Desktop |Occasional |Homeowner|On-premises|Contains private information, like photos.|Restricted|
| Guest Smartphone |Occasional  |Friend|On and Off-premises|Connects to my home network.|Internal-only|
| Smartphone | Occasional |Homeowner|On and Off-premises|Contains private information,same as Desktop.Connects to my home network.|Restricted|
| Game console |Occasional |Homeowner|On-premises|Connects to my home network.Contains games,films.apps.|Internal-only|
| External Hard Driver |Occasional  |Homeowner|On-premises|Contains backup photoes,documents,files.|Confidential|

### Summary

Maintaining an accurate asset inventory is a critical first step in cybersecurity. Without knowing what assets exist, it is impossible to properly protect systems, detect threats, or respond to incidents.
This project reinforced the importance of visibility, documentation, and structured security thinking.
